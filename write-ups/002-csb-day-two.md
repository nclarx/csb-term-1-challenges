# Day Two

*7th June 2019*

## Overview

-   Workbook - overview of tools
-   Bash Terminal
-   Python Environment Setup

Hi all

Today we started off with a Kahoot quiz to introduce you to the platform - this was anticlimactic because Nick's laptop ran out of battery in the middle of it (he promises this won't happen again).

A **workbook** for Bash commands and scripting was then provided and we went through the [Crash Course in Bash Walkthru](https://gist.github.com/nclarx/83b411bd2ed3f0547dfd10a60f6d83ee).

People then worked through the activity from the Walkthru and the workbook and got into the bash challenges on [CMD Challenge.com](https://cmdchallenge.com).The [Search for Files Containing String](https://cmdchallenge.com/#/search_for_files_containing_string) problem seemed to stump a few people. Here is the link to the solutions page for this problem. You should have a look through and see all the different approaches to solving the problem - some are better than others… some are gaming the system and still getting the right answer… see: <https://cmdchallenge.com/s/#/search_for_files_containing_string>

We did a breakdown of a PC and explain how the hardware of a computer works from key hardware components such as the:

-   RAM
-   CPU
-   HDD
-   GPU

Also we heard an explanation about how CPUs work, RAM and how a computer queues up millions of operations, and:

-   how coding languages are either compiled or interpreted (using a compiler or interpreter)
-   low-level languages such as **assembly** are difficult to code in because they are verbose
-   high-level languages like **Python** are easier for humans to understand because they abstract away the complexity of working directly with hardware and make it harder for humans to write code that will cause catastrophic errors that completely crash the operating system

We also did a lot of setting up of Python, Linux environments and IDEs!
