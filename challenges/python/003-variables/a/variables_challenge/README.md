# Variables challenge

## Introduction

We use variables to store values in memory so that we can operate on the values.

## One

Find out the diameter of the sun and then store this in a variable. Ask the user to enter a number. Calculate the number as a percentage of the sun's diameter.

## Two

Ask the user to enter a temperature in celsius. Calculate the temperature as fahrenheit.

## Three

Ask the user to enter a temperature in fahrenheit. Calculate the temperature as celcius.

## Four

Ask the user to enter the number of animals and birds and insects in their fake zoo. Calculate the number of legs in the fake zoo!

## Five

Ask the user the following questions, and then store the responses in variables. Assemble the individual variable values into a single string.
* "What is your first name?"
* "What is your last name?"
* "What is your street number?"
* "What is the name of your street?"
* "What is the name of your suburb?"
* "What is the name of your city?"
* "What is your postcode?"
