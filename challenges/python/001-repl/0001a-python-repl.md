# 1 Python REPL

## 1.1 Check your python version

Check which version of Python you have installed (compare this to the version that should be installed according to the instructor).

```bash
âžœ  ~ python --version
```

*What is the version of Python installed on your computer/environment?*

## 1.2 Simple Mathematical Operations

These challenges ask you to use a range of basic operators to perform calculations.

###  Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division

Python has the `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**` and `//` and `%`  operators which allow you to perform simple calculations.

### 1.3 Integer and Floating Point Numbers

**Integer** and **float** are two different types of number data types that will be covered more fully in a later challenge. For now, complete the exercises below that show how mathematical operations work with **integers** and **floats**.

>   An integer is a whole number, which is a number that does not have a decimal point following it.
>
>   A float or floating point number has a decimal point, the numbers to the left of the decimal point are whole numbers, whereas the numbers to the right of the decimal point are a fraction of the whole number.

Complete the following challenges to find out what happens when you combine the following floats and integers.

| No.       | Challenge                                     | Expected | Answer |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| **1.3.1** | Will `3.0 / 2` produce an integer or a float? |          |        |
| **1.3.2** | Will `3 / 2` produce an integer or a float?   |          |        |
| **1.3.3** | Will `4**2.0` produce an integer or a float?  |          |        |
| **1.3.4** | Will `4.1 % 2` produce an integer or a float? |          |        |
| **1.3.5** | Calculate how many hours are in one year      |          |        |
| **1.3.6** | Calculate how many minutes are in a decade    |          |        |
| **1.3.7** | Calculate how many seconds old you are        |          |        |

## 1.4 Strings

What do you think the output will be if you type these into the Python REPL?

Record the output you expect, and the actual output.

|            | Challenge                                                                  | Expected answer | Answer |
| :--------: | -----------------------------------------------------------------------    | :-------------: | :----: |
| **1.4.1**  | Provide an expected answer for `"tom" * 3` and then run it in the REPL     |                 |        |
| **1.4.2**  | Provide an expected answer for `"tom" + "tom"` and then run it in the REPL |                 |        |
| **1.4.3**  | Provide an expected answer for `"tom" + 1 and then run it in the REPL      |                 |        |
| **1.4.4**  | Provide an expected answer for `"tom" / 2` and then run it in the REPL     |                 |        |

## 1.4.5 Underscore in REPL

When you use the underscore `\_` character in the Python REPL it signifies the last value handled by the interpreter.

What happens when you:

```python
>>> 1 + 1
# Result?

>>> _ + 4
# Result?

```
