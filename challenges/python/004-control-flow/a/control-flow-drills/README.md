## Background 
- Grasp the fundamentals of control flow

## Specs 

Solve these challenges in order.

1. Take this code and run it: 

```python
if True:
    print("hello")
else:
    print("goodbye")
```

What does it print to the screen? Why is this the case?

2. Now replace the `if true` with `if false`

What does it print to the screen now. Why?

3. Create a variable that stores a pet as a boolean

```python
pet = True
```

Create an if else that if pet

```python
if pet == True
```

print to the screen "I have a pet", else print to the screen "I don't have a pet"

4. How can we refactor the code we just wrote?

5. Define a name variable with your own name as a string. 

If name is equal to your own name print to the screen "Hi, my name is {name}" else puts "that isn't my name!!!"

6. Instead of setting the name variable as a hard coded string, I want you to get the name from the command line using gets.

7. You're at 120 spencer street. Make 4 variables. level_8 is the string "reception", level_13 is the string "old coder room", level_12 is the string "classroom", location is also "classroom". Now follow this control flow logic: 

```txt
if level 8 is equal to location print "im on level 8"  
elsif level 13 is equal to location print "im on level 13" 
elsif level 12 is equal to location print "im on level 12"
else print "im not at 120 spencer street"
```

8. How would we hit the else case in the above question?

9. Ask a user (yourself) "how many coffees you drink in a day"? Store the number as user input. Now follow this control flow logic:

```txt
if you drink 0 (integer) coffees in a day print to the screen "saving $$"
if you drink 1 coffee in a day print "a little but of caffeine doesn't hurt"
if you drink 2 coffees in a day print "i need my coffee hit"
if you drink 3 coffees in a day print "hmm it's getting a bit much"
if you drink more than 3 coffees in a day print "AHHHHH so much caffeine"
```

If the code is breaking think about data types.
    
10. Define a number variable with any integer. If the variable is odd print "it's odd" if the variable is even puts "it's even". There are two different ways to go about this, using a modulo operator and using inbuilt python functions, answer the question using both of these approaches

11. Instead of hard coding the number variable use `input()`. Again remember data types!
