# Can I Vote

## Introduction

You're super excited, as its currently election time. You put on your best shirt, and walk down to the polling booth. However, when you get there, you are surprised to see them checking people's ID.

## Specs

Write a function that takes an integer as an input, which represents your age. The function will use this number and either return "Hooray! You're old enough to have your say!" if you are 18 or older or "Whoops, you have to be at least 18 to vote." if you are younger than 18

*E.g.* can_i_vote(17) should return "Whoops, you have to be at least 18 to vote."

*E.g.* can_i_vote(18) should return "Hooray! You're old enough to have your say!"

## Optional

See if you can complete this challenge in one line of code!
