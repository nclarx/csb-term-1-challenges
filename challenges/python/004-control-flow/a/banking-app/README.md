* Part One, Two, Three: If, Elsif, Else
* Optional One: Loop
* Optional Two: List

## Introduction

We can make decisions in our code by using If, Elsif, Else blocks.

## Part One

* A user's initial balance is 0.0.
* Display the user's balance.
* Ask the user what they would like to do.
* If they type "balance", display their balance.
* If the user types anything other than "balance", display the message "Invalid selection!".

## Part Two

* Add "deposit" as a program option.
* If the user types "deposit", ask the user for the deposit amount and then add this to the user's current balance.

## Part Three
* Add "withdraw" as a program option.
* If the user types "withdraw", ask the user for the withdrawal amount and then deduct this from the user's current balance.
* Note: The user should not be allowed to withdraw more than their current balance!

## Optional One
* Enclose the program statements in a loop to allow the program to repeat until the user chooses to exit the program.

## Optional Two
* Store the value of each transaction in a list.
* Add "view history" as a program option.
* If this option is selected, display each transaction.
