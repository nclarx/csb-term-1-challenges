# Quiz Time

## Introduction

A new quiz show is airing on channel 9. It involves a contestant answering 10 questions, earning themselves $100,000 with each correct answer. Can you win the million dollars?

## Specs

Write a function that will ask the contestant 10 questions. Each question will have 4 possible answers, with one of them being correct. Each time a contestant answers the questions, if they get it correct, let them know, and tell them their current prize. If they get it wrong, let them know, and tell them their current prize. At the end of the 10 questions, tell the contestant how much money they have won; if they get the million dollars, have a big celebration message


## Optional

A challenge like this has the potential to end up being a huge file. See if you can implement loops, multiple functions and/or recursion to keep the code as DRY as possible
