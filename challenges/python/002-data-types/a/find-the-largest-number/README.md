# Find the Largest Number

## Introduction

Computers are able to compare numbers, and know which is larger and which is smaller.

## Specs

Write a function that will take two numbers, and return whichever is larger. If the numbers are equal, it should return "Numbers are equal".

*E.g.* largest_number(100,50) should return 100

*E.g.* largest_number(10,10) should return "Numbers are equal"


## Optional

Can you set this function up, so, if it is given a variable that is not a number, it returns "Make sure both inputs are numbers", as oppose to erroring out.
