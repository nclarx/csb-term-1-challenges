# 2 Data Types A

## 2.1 Boolean

Complete the following challenges relating to boolean data types.

> The `==` is a comparison operator that can be used to compare two values to see whether they are the same or not. If the values are the same, the expression will return `True` if the values are different it will return `False`.

See the documentation on `==`:
See the documentation on `Bool`:

**Instructions:**

**PLEASE READ ALL INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE STARTING THIS CHALLENGE**

1. Note the answer you expect for each challenge.
2. Create a Python script file named `002-Data-Types.py`.
3. Use comments to label each challenge with its *No.*.
4. Print the result of each expression with a `print()` statement.
5. Do not run your script until you have completed Instructions 1-4.
6. Check the results of your script against the expected value.
