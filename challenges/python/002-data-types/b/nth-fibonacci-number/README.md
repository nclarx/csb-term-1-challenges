# Nth Fibonacci Number

## Introduction

A Fibonacci sequence is a list of numbers that begins with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. I.e. 0,1,1,2,3,5,8...

## Specs

Write a function that will return the nth number of the sequence. The syntax is easy, getting your heard around the algorithm is the challenge. It might be worth writing this in pseudocode before writing the function.

*E.g.* nth_fibonacci(0) should return 0

*E.g.* nth_fibonacci(3) should return 2

*E.g.* nth_fibonacci(6) should return 8
